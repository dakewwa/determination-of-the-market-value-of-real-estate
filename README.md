## Description
Research of advertisements for apartments for sale
You have at your disposal data from the Yandex Real Estate service - an archive of apartment listings for sale in St. Petersburg and neighboring cities for several years. You need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate objects. To do this, conduct a research analysis of the data and establish the parameters that influence the price of objects. This will allow you to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.

Two types of data are available for each apartment for sale. The first is entered by the user, the second is obtained automatically on the basis of cartographic data. For example, the distance to the center, airport and other objects - this data is automatically obtained from geoservices. The number of parks and water bodies is also filled in without the user's participation.

The price of an apartment mainly depends on such factors as area, number of rooms, floor, distance from the center and the date of posting the ad. The average selling time of an apartment is approximately 193 days. The greatest price dependence on the distance from the center of St. Petersburg is observed within 10 kilometers.
